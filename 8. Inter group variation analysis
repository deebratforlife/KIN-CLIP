# The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), also known as one-factor ANOVA, 
# is an extension of independent two-samples t-test for comparing means in a situation where there are more than two groups. 
# In one-way ANOVA, the data is organized into several groups base on one single grouping variable (also called factor variable). 

# ANOVA test hypotheses:

# Null hypothesis: the means of the different groups are the same
# Alternative hypothesis: At least one sample mean is not equal to the others.

# Note that, in case of only two groups, t-test can be used. In this case the F-test and the t-test are equivalent.

# Following assumptions were met:

# The observations are obtained independently and randomly from the population defined by the factor levels
# The data of each factor level are normally distributed.
# These normal populations have a common variance. (Levene’s test can be used to check this.)

# Multiple pairwise-comparison between the means of groups
# In one-way ANOVA test, a significant p-value indicates that some of the group means are different, but we don’t know which pairs of groups are different.

# It’s possible to perform multiple pairwise-comparison, to determine if the mean difference between specific pairs of group are statistically significant.

# Tukey multiple pairwise-comparisons
# As the ANOVA test is significant, we can compute Tukey HSD (Tukey Honest Significant Differences, R function: TukeyHSD()) for performing multiple pairwise-comparison between the means of groups.

# The function TukeyHD() takes the fitted ANOVA as an argument.
