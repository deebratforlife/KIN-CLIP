# Let us import our data file and give it a name. 
# A note here: Boxplotting requires arranging data in a vertical matrix format where Column A contains all box plot items that go
# in x-axis and Column B contains y-axis ranges.

df <- KIN-CLIP.txt

# Basic box plot uses the following:
p <- ggplot(test, aes(x=V1, y=V2)) + 
     geom_boxplot()
    
# or
     
p <- ggboxplot (df, x = "supp", y = "len",
     color = "black", palette = c("blue", "red", "white")
	 outlier.shape = NA)
	 
# Both ggplot and ggboxplot gives the same results here.
	 
# Now we define some box plot properties such as y axis limit, data point size, appearance, color, position, level of jitter and theme 
# to decide on overall (with margins, grids etc.) appearance of boxplots.

p + theme_classic() + ylim(1, 50) + geom_point (aes(color = V1),
position = position_jitterdodge(jitter.width = 1.0), cex = 2.8, alpha = 0.3) + scale_color_manual(values=c("red", "blue"))
	
# For obtaining p-value of inter-group differences:

library(ggpubr)

p + stat_compare_means(method = "ANOVA")
# This performs one or two way ANOVA. Details are provided in M&M.
