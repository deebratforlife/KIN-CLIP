# The kinetic landscape of an RNA binding protein in cells.

# Gene expression in higher eukaryotic cells orchestrates interactions between thousands of
# RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and tens of thousands of RNAs 1. The kinetics by which RBPs
# bind to and dissociate from their RNA sites are critical for the coordination of cellular RNA-
# protein interactions 2. However, these kinetic parameters were experimentally inaccessible in
# cells. Here we show that time-resolved RNA-protein crosslinking with a pulsed femtosecond UV
# laser, followed by immunoprecipitation and high throughput sequencing allows the
# determination of binding and dissociation kinetics of the RBP Dazl for thousands of individual
# RNA binding sites in cells. This kinetic crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (KIN-CLIP)
# approach reveals that Dazl resides at individual binding sites only seconds or shorter, while the
# sites remain Dazl-free markedly longer. The data further indicate that Dazl binds to many RNAs
# in clusters of multiple proximal sites. The impact of Dazl on mRNA levels and ribosome
# association correlates with the cumulative probability of Dazl binding in these clusters.
# Integrating kinetic data with mRNA features quantitatively connects Dazl-RNA binding to Dazl
# function. Our results show how previously inaccessible, kinetic parameters for RNA-protein
# interactions in cells can be measured and how these data quantitatively link RBP-RNA binding
# to cellular RBP function.

#This repo has scripts useful for creating advanced data analyses plots, heatmaps, matrices and to perform data fitting.

# These scripts already exist in the literature. The pre existing scripts were modified/customized as and when suitable for data analyses purposes.

# Scripts may behave differently depending on the operating system setup, coding environment etc.
